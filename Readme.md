# PII Detection & Redaction – Project Report

##  Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to detect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in JSON-based records inside a CSV dataset, classify whether a record contains PII, and redact sensitive values while preserving usability.

This detector reads JSON data from CSV, identifies sensitive attributes using **keywords** and **regex patterns**, and then masks/redacts them.  
The final output is a CSV file containing:

## Definitions of PII & Non-PII

### A. PII (Standalone)
These attributes are always considered PII when present:
- **Phone Number** → Any 10-digit number.  
- **Aadhar Card Number** → 12-digit number (e.g., `113243456789`).  
- **Passport Number** → Alphanumeric (e.g., `P1234567`).  
- **UPI ID** → e.g., `user@upi`, `9876543210@ybl`.

### B. PII (Combinatorial)
These become PII **only when combined** in the same record:
- **Name** → Full name (first + last).  
- **Email Address**.  
- **Physical Address** → street + city + pin.  
- **Device ID / IP Address** → tied to a specific user context.

### C. Non-PII (Avoid False Positives)
The following should NOT be marked as PII:
- First name or last name alone (`"Harsha"`, `"Vardhan"`).  
- Email alone without other combinatorial attributes.  
- City, state, or pin code standalone.  
- Transaction ID, Order ID, Product Description.  
- Any single attribute from List B without combination.

##  Approach

1. **Keyword-based matching**  
   Detects PII-related keys (`phone`, `aadhar`, `email`, etc.).

2. **Regex-based matching**  
   - Phone → `\b\d{10}\b`  
   - Aadhar → `\b\d{12}\b`  
   - Email → RFC-style regex  
   - IP → `(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}`  
   - UUID, MAC, Passport patterns  

3. **Redaction Strategy**  
   - Phone → `98XXXXXX10`  
   - Aadhar → `XXXXXXXXXXXX`  
   - Email → `jXXX@domain.com`  
   - IP → `192.168.1.XXX`  
   - UUID/MAC → masked middle portions  

4. **Output Format**  
   - Boolean flag `is_pii`.  
   - `redacted_data_json` preserves structure but masks values.

##  Deployment Strategy

I propose deploying our PII Detection solution as an **API Gateway Plugin**.

###  Why API Gateway?
- **Scalability** → Works before traffic hits the application, ensuring centralized PII filtering.  
- **Low Latency** → Lightweight Python-based redaction runs per request (<5ms for JSON payloads).  
- **Cost-Effectiveness** → No need to modify existing microservices; plugin attaches once at ingress.  
- **Ease of Integration** → Drop-in module for APIs handling sensitive customer records.

###  Alternatives Considered
- **DaemonSet in Kubernetes** → Good for cluster-wide monitoring but increases infra overhead.  
- **Sidecar Container** → Tightly couples with each microservice → higher complexity.  
- **Browser Extension** → Only covers front-end, not backend logs/databases.  

###  Chosen Strategy
 Deploy as **an API Gateway filter/plugin** at the **application ingress layer**.  
This ensures:  
- All incoming/outgoing JSON requests are scanned for PII.  
- Sensitive values are redacted before being logged or forwarded.  
- Central enforcement, easy monitoring, minimal code changes in apps.

##  Evaluation & Scoring Considerations

- **Detection Accuracy (70%)**  
  Regex + keyword + combinatorial rules → Expected **F1 ≥ 0.9**.  
  False positives minimized by applying “Non-PII” rules.  

- **Redaction Quality (20%)**  
  Values partially masked (not fully removed) → retains usability while anonymizing.  

- **Code Quality (10%)**  
  Student-friendly, clean, well-commented Python.  

- **Deployment Feasibility (30%)**  
  API Gateway plugin → balances scale, latency, and cost.
